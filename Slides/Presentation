# Kalman Filters 

- What it is
- How it works
- Example
- Sensor fusion
- Example
*Malachi Hibbins*

## Introduction
- Kalman filters are an optimal estimation algorithm which looks at noisy measurements and attempts to predict the true state 
- A Kalman filter considers:
- **The model**: *Predicts* the next state from the current state *estimate*.
- **The measurement** containing noise
- And combines these to form an *updated estimate* of the state.

---
## Prediction 

- The true state, $x_k$, evolves according to the linear model defined in $A$:
$$x_{k} = Ax_{k-1} + w_{k-1}$$
- $w_k$ is white noise associated with the linear process.  $w_k \sim \mathcal{N}(0, Q)$
- However we don't have access to $x_k$ or only its estimate $\hat{x}_k$. 
>Predict next state
>$$\hat{x}^-_{k} = A \hat{x}_{k-1}$$
>Calculate the error covariance of prediction
>$$P^-_{k} = AP_{k-1}A^T+Q$$
- $P_k$ and $P^-_{k}$ are error covariance matrices for $\hat{x}_k$ and $\hat{x}^-_k$
- $Q$ is the error covariance matrix for $w_k$

## Measurment
- The measurment ($z_k$) is the measurment from the sensor:
  $$z_k = Hx_k + v_k$$
- $H$ is the state to measurment matrix. 
- $v_k$ is the noise associated with the measurment. $v_k \sim \mathcal{N}(0, R)$
- Equation on its own is unhelpful since we don't have access to $x_k$ or $v_k$
- We can say the following about the predicted ($\hat{z}^-_k$) and estimated ($\hat{z}_k$) measurments based on the model
$$\hat{z}^-_k = H\hat{x}^-_k$$
$$\hat{z}_k = H\hat{x}_k$$

--- 

## Update

- $\hat{x}^-_{k+1}$ is combined with the measurment, $z_k$, to give the updated estimate, $\hat{x}_{k+1}$:
>Estimate Update Equation
>$$
>\hat{x}_{k} = \hat{x}^-_k + K_k(z_k - H\hat{x}^-_k)
>$$
- $K_k$ is the kalman gain. Recalculated for each step to minise the MSE between true state and estimation
- $H$ is the state to measurment matrix
>Estimate Update Alternative Form
$$\hat{x}_k = \hat{x}^-_k + K_k(z_k - \hat{z}^-_k)$$
